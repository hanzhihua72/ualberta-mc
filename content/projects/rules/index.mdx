## Welcome to the server!

This is a survival minecraft server for University of Alberta students, however feel free to join even if you do not go to uAlberta. A feature is that there are **almost no rules on this server.** As such, **griefing is allowed, and there is no grief protection whatsoever.**

## Rules:

-   Extreme hacks that break gameplay and lag the server will result in a 5 second ban.

## Clans:

Clans is supported by this server, which allows players to not take damage from teammates, the ability to teleport to a base, and access to a private chat.

To use clans, simply type: `/clan` in the server. This allows you to create and manage your clan, and invite/accept clan invites.

Only the player who created a clan is allowed to use the `/clan delete` and `/clan setbase` commands.
